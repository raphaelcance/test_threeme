\begin_layout Abstract
Since 2008, the ADEME and the OFCE are involved in a research convention
 to develop the model Three-ME.
 This document provides a full description of new version of the model.
 Three-ME is a new model of the French economy especially designed to evaluate
 the medium and long term impact of environmental and energy policies at
 the macroeconomic and sector levels.
 To do so Three-ME combines two important features.
 Firstly, it has the main characteristics of neo-Keynesian models by assuming
 a slow adjustment of effective quantities and prices to their notional
 level, an endogenous money supply, a Taylor rule and a Philips curve.
 Compared to standard multi-sector CGEM, this has the advantage to allow
 for the existence of under-optimum equilibria such as the presence of involunta
ry unemployment.
 Secondly, Three-ME is a hybrid model in the sense that it combines the
 top-down approach of general equilibrium macroeconomic models with elements
 of bottom-up models of energy models developed by engineers.
 As in bottom-up models, the amount of energy consumed is related to their
 use, that is the number of buildings or cars, and the energy class to which
 they belong.
 This hypothesis is more realistic compared to the assumption made in the
 majority of top-down models where energy consumption is usually directly
 related to income through a nested structure of utility function.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Top-down Computable General Equilibrium Models (CGEM) are often used to
 evaluate a wide range of economic problems.
 They have the advantage to combine tractability with a high level of detail,
 being able to distinguish different countries, goods, type of consumer,
 etc

 Particularly important for the analysis of the economic impact of environmental
 and energy policy, they often account for an important number of sectors:
 e.g.
 GREEN has 11 sectors

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But CGEM have two important drawbacks.
 First, they rely on very restrictive assumptions relative to the functioning
 of the economy especially in the short and medium run.
 CGEM are supply models where the hypothesis of perfect price flexibility
 and money neutrality often insures the full and optimal use of production
 factors and thus rule out permanent or transitory under-optimum equilibrium
 such as the presence of involuntary unemployment.
 They neglect, the dynamic effects of the demand side, and especially the
 multiplier effect of the public investment, by assuming a total eviction
 between private and public spendings.
 This result is due to the hypothesis that the interest rate insures the
 equilibrium betwen investment and savings, in a framework where the money
 supply is exogenous.
 Neo-Keynesian macroeconomic models, also called Aggregate Demand-Aggregate
 Supply (AS-AD) models, try to give a more realistic representation of the
 actual functioning of the economy taking explicitly into account slow adjustmen
ts of prices and quantities, an endogenous money supply, thus allowing for
 permanent or transitory under-optimum equilibrium.
 This effort seems to have a cost in terms of the disaggregation level which
 is often limited.
 This is typically the case for currently running macroeconomic models for
 the French economy: e.g.
 MESANGE of the French ministry of Economy has three sectors

 However, earlier versions of these models in the 1980’s and 1990’s had
 a higher level of disaggregation, between 6 and 8 products (see Economie
 et Prévision, 1998)

 But still, neo-Keynesian macroeconomic models generally do not distinguish
 between the different types of energy or of transport which are particularly
 important for the assessment of environmental and energy policy

 They are thus likely to neglect the effect of activity transfers in terms
 of growth and employment from high to low intensive energy sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second limit particularly important for the analysis of the economic impact
 of environmental and energy policy is that CGEM provide an insufficient
 representation of endogenous energy efficiency phenomena
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This limit explains partially why existing models have trouble to represent
 and model realistically energy and environmental issues as recently acknowledge
 by a recent FP7 research proposal (ENV.2012.6.1-2) on the “Development of
 advanced techno-economic modeling tools for assessing costs and impacts
 of mitigation policies” that states: “Currently available [techno-economic
 modeling] tools have relevant limitations such as the difficulty to represent
 pervasive technological developments, the difficulty to represent non-lineariti
es, thresholds and irreversibility, and the insufficiently developed representat
ion of economic sectors with a significant potential for mitigation and
 resource efficiency.”

For instance, households consumption behaviors are generally represented
 through a nested structure of utility function which defines a simple correlati
on between the level of consumption of each goods and the revenue.
 This link is often log-linear, that is linear in relative terms: a 1% increase
 in the real revenue leads to a 1% increase in the consumption of each goods.
 To account for non-linearities, it is usual to introduce a Linear Expenditure
 System (LES) utility function 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Reference!!
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A LES specification assumes that a share of the base year consumption is
 incompressible and therefore the relation between income and consumption
 is not linear anymore.
 This specification allows for the distinction between consumption of necessity
 and luxurious goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the LES utility function improves the realism of the modeling of
 consumption behavior, it still rely on the theoretical representation that
 each good provides a direct utility to households.
 This is not a realistic assumption for certain goods such as energy.
 As formalized theoretically by Lancaster

, households do not consume energy for their direct utility but rather for
 the service they provide when combined with a capital goods such as a car
 or a house.
 There is no point buying gasoline if one does not have a car.
 A more realistic theoretical representation is therefore to assume that
 energy is an input used in combination with different types of capital
 in a households production function.
 This representation accounts for the fact that in reality certain services
 are not always externally purchased by households but rather directly produced
 by them.
 This is typically the case for transports.
 Households can directly purchase a transportation service produced by an
 activity such as public transport.
 Alternatively, they can invest in a capital by purchasing a car and buy
 the necessary amount of gasoline that fulfills their needs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compared to the assumption made in standard top-down representation, there
 is hardly any direct utility from energy alone.
 This is of course different for other goods, although many commodities
 have similar properties to energy.
 For instance, a big share of water consumption is related to the use of
 appliances.
 The number of appliances generally depends on the number of houses.
 The amount construction material used is closely related to the size of
 the house.
 Relating the consumption of these goods directly to the revenue, as assumed
 in the standard top-down representation, may therefore lead to unrealistic
 results, where the consumptions expressed in physical units exceed their
 saturation levels.
 Indeed, it is unlikely that an household will ever decide to buy 6 cars,
 10 washing machines or to heat its house at 35°C even if it becomes richer
 in the future.
 Because of their monetary representation, one cannot exclude that standard
 top-down CG models produce such unrealistic development in the long run
 due to the general increase of the standard of living.
 Only a physical (along with a monetary) representation allows for the inclusion
 of realistic floor and ceiling in the consumption of certain goods.

Three-ME (Multi-sector Macroeconomic Model for the Evaluation of Environmental
 and Energy policy) is a new model of the French economy developed by the
 ADEME, OFCE and TNO.
 Its main purpose is to evaluate the impact of environmental and energy
 policy measures on the economy at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels.
 Moreover it has the ambition to overcome the two limitation of standard
 top-down CGEM pointed above by introducing neo-Keynesian features such
 as inertia in price and quantities and bottom-up features in the modeling
 of consumption behavior.

Having the general structure of neo-Keynesian macroeconomic models, Three-ME
 seems more realistic than the standard CGEM for describing the actual dynamic
 of the economy at least in the short and medium run.
 In the long run, the model is neo-classical in the sense of Solow

 since it converges toward a steady states where all variables grow at a
 constant rate.
 Disaggregated in 37 sectors with an explicit distinction between 13 types
 of energy sources and five types of transports, it allows for the neo-Keynesian
 short/medium term macroeconomic modeling approach to catch-up with the
 most advanced CGEM in terms of sectoral analysis.
 In addition, its hybrid structure regarding the specification of the behavior
 of households overcomes the restrictions imposed by nested utility approach
 assumed in standard CGEM.

, the following important improvements were made:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 4 energy sectors of the previous version (coal, petroleum, electricity
 and gas) have been subdivided into 13 sectors in order to better account
 for the impact of renewable energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The model distinghishes now commodities from activities: the number of activitie
s is not equal to the number of commodities and each activity can potentially
 produce any commodity.
 This is typically the case for energy sectors that may produce the same
 commodity.
 For instance, the commodity electricity is produced by several activities:
 nuclear, wind, solar, etc.
 Another exemple is the activity agriculture that produces several commodities:
 agricultural product, food, biofuel and biogas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Because of access restriction to National account investment data, investment
 decisions were modeled for the all the private sector.
 We now use detailed investment data disaggregated by sector and therefore
 identify a specific investment pattern for each activity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The modeling of households' behaviors has been improved.
 The number of households has increases from 1 to 5, classified by quintile
 of revenue.
 In the previous version, only 2 energy classes (efficient and other) for
 buildings and cars were distinguished.
 The new version includes 7 energy classes for buildings and cars that follows
 the standard A to G classification.
 The link between energy consumption and stock was rather 
\shape italic
ad hoc
\shape default
 since we assumed a loglinear negative correlation between energy consumption
 and the share of the efficient stock.
 The level of energy consumption (and thus of CO2 emissions) is directly
 related to the type of buildings or cars and is also expressed in physical
 units.
 Finally, the arbitrage between the different classes of investments is
 not directly a function of price of energy but of the relative user cost
 of each investment which includes the expected energy related costs.

.
 In the short term, Three-ME has the main characteristics of a standard
 neo-Keynesian macroeconomic AS-AD model in an open economy.
 An important one is that demand determines supply.
 The demand is composed of (intermediate and final) consumption, investment
 and export whereas the supply comes from imports and the domestic production.
 As a feed-back with eventually some lags, the supply affects the demand
 through several mechanisms.
 The level of production determines the quantity of inputs used by the firms
 and thus the quantity of their intermediate consumptions and investment
 which are two components of the demand.
 It determines the level of employment as well and consequently the households’
 final consumption.
 Another effect of employment on demand goes through the wage setting via
 the unemployment rate which is also determined by the active population.
 The active population is mainly determined by exogenous factors such as
 demography but also by endogenous factors: because of discouraged worker
 effects, the unemployment rate may affect the labor participation rate
 and thus the active population.

\begin_layout Standard
The unemployment rate is an important determinant of the wages dynamic which
 is defined by a Phillips curve.
 The inflationary property of the model is determined by the feedbacks between
 wages, production cost and prices.
 Prices are assumed to adjust slowly to their optimum level that corresponds
 to a mark-up over marginal costs.
 In the short term, the mark-up accounts for the tensions between production
 capacities (supply) and demand , which is a classical market property.
 Consequently, wages, which affect production costs, affect directly prices.
 Prices have in return an impact on wages because they are indexed on the
 consumer price inflation.
 Production costs are also directly affected by prices via the cost of intermedi
ate consumptions and of investment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This dynamic between wages, cost and prices affects the demand through several
 canals.
 Wages affect the household consumption because they are an important part
 of their income.
 Prices and cost affect profits and thus sectors’ debts level.
 But they affect the households’ consumption and investment too because
 they finance a part of the private debt of the economy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another canal is the monetary policy which is defined by a Taylor rule.
 The European central bank determines the interest rate level based on the
 European inflation and unemployment.
 This has an effect on the demand via the negative effect of the real interest
 rate on consumption and investment.
 Thus, in this model, interest rate is not directly determined by the equilibriu
m between investment and saving as generally assumed in the CGEM Models
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This is an important feature because the optimum cannot automatically be
 reached if this hypothesis does not prevail.
 In most CGE models, all incomes are spent, since all the savings finances
 instantly invesment.
 Therefore the supply value is always equal to the demand value.
 Combined with the hypothesis of a perfect prices flexibility, this assessment
 ensure that there is no outlet constraint and that all the production factors
 are used (that is why there is no unvoluntary unemployment, unless there
 are some exogenous rigidities on the labor market).
 In the neo-keynesian model, the equality between investment and savings
 is not ensured by the interest rate flexibility anymore.
 Therefore, the investment is not determined by the amount of savings.
 It depends on both the demand and the price of capital.
 The savings level adjusts to the investment amount, thanks to the fluctuations
 of activity.
 In that case, investment is implicitly financed by monetary creation, that
 is to say by the credits offered by the banks.
 Therefore the money is endogenous since investment depends on demand.
 By this fact, in a context of prices rigidities and unvoluntary unemployment,
 a demand shock may have a positiv effect on the production level in the
 short and middle terms since it influences the investment level, and therefore
 the amount of available capital factor.
 Money is not neutral any more.
 The eviction effect of the public spendings is not total, since the global
 amount of investment is not fixed by a exogenous propensity to save.
 Nevertheless, there is always a modest eviction effect because investment
 entails inflation and unemployment reduction, which lead to an increase
 in interest rate.
 In the long term, the public spending has a permanent and positive effect
 on the production level, if the direct and indirect incomes generated by
 the public investments are superior to the debt reimbursment and interest
 charges (that is to say the money destruction).
 In that case, one can concieve that the strike against climate change may
 provide some long term benefits, if the Net Present Value of the induced
 investments is positiv and if the global variation of investment is positive
 or compensated by a reduction of the trade deficit or an increase in consumptio
n due to a better labor intensity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dynamic of prices is the driver of the substitution mechanisms of the
 model.
 The evolution of relative prices between imported and domestic goods defines
 the repartition between imported and domestic products to satisfy the internal
 (consumption and investments) and external (export) demand.
 The evolution of relative prices between types of goods and services defines
 the structure of consumption of the economy.
 Importantly for the analysis of environmental and energy policies, it defines
 the share of each energy and transport into (intermediate and final) consumptio
ns.

Three-ME accounts for 5 types of households ranked according to their revenue
 quantile.
 It also explicitly distinguishes between five types of transports and four
 types of energy (resp.
 red and yellow lines in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Sectors"

\end_inset

).
 Energy intensity was the main criterion for the selection of the 24 sectors.
 In order to better account for the impact of renewable energy, the 4 energy
 sectors (coal, petroleum, electricity and gas) have been subdivided into
 13 sub-sectors.
 This relatively high level of disaggregation is important to capture the
 complexity of the substitution mechanisms involved after a change in the
 relative price between energies.
 For instance, an increase in the oil price tends to lead to substitution
 from oil to the other energy in several ways.
 In addition to direct substitutions by producer and consumer, indirect
 effects occur via the increase of the production price of oil intensive
 sectors.
 This leads to intermediate and final consumptions structure less oil intensive.
 The decrease of the use of transport by road would be the most typical
 example.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three-ME accounts also for endogenous energy efficiency and sobriety effects.
 In contrast with the substitution mechanisms, the reduction of a given
 energy consumption does not imply the increase of the use of another energy.
 Sobriety consists in refraining from consuming energy by for instance staying
 home during the weekend instead of taking the car or by lowering the heating
 temperature in the house.
 In general, sobriety leads to a decrease in the welfare of the consumer.
 In contrast, in the case of efficiency, the same welfare is achieved with
 a lower quantity of energy.
 Energy efficiency implies an investment in a more efficient technology
 by for instance switching from a high to a low oil consumption car or by
 using more efficient insulation techniques for the house.
 In the model, endogenous efficiency phenomena are introduced through an
 explicit distinction between several types of housing and automobile investment
s, classified according to their energy consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Three-ME, efficiency and sobriety phenomenas decrease the consumer price
 since the share of energy into consumption decreases (see Section 5).
 This allows for directly capturing the so-called “rebound effect” in consumptio
n behavior often observed at the micro level (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Bentzen:2004uq"

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Sorrell:2009hc"

\end_inset

).
 There is a rebound effect when the effective energy saving from an investment
 in energy efficiency is less than the energy saving expected ex ante because
 the consumer uses a part of the reduction of her energy bill to increase
 her energy consumption.
 A typical example is the case of certain poor households who live in badly
 insulated houses and set a low heating temperature to reduce their energy
 bill.
 After an insulation investment, they will have the tendency to increase
 the heating temperature of their house keeping their energy bill more or
 less constant.
 This effect is explicitly taken into account in the model: an energy efficiency
 investment decreases the consumer price and thus increases the real income
 which leads to a higher level of (energy) consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
Moreover, Three-ME is a hybrid model in the sense that it combines the top-down
 approach of general equilibrium macroeconomic models with elements of bottom-up
 models of energy "engineer" models.
 The top-down structure presented above gives the macroeconomic consistency
 and allows for taking into account the feedback between price and quantity
 that are generally absent in the bottom-up models where prices are exogenous.
 As in bottom-up models, the amount of energy consumed households is related
 to their use, that is to say the number of buildings or cars, and the energy
 class to which they belong.
 There are limits on the number of vehicles or housing per households, energy
 consumption per vehicle or per housing which avoid to simulate unrealistic
 rebound or wealth effects.
 This framework differs from the majority of top-down models where energy
 consumption is usually directly related to income through a nested structure
 of utility function and not expressed in physical units which may lead
 to unrealistic representation of the future (e.g.
 heating temperature to 35 º C in the house, 5 cars per person).
 We therefore believe that this hybrid setting is particularly important
 for the analysis of environmental policy where the time horizon is long.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The short and medium run dynamic is largely driven by the demand side through
 multiplier and accelerator mechanisms.
 Because of the slow adjustment of price and quantity to their optimal value,
 the allocation of production factors is sub-optimal in the short and medium
 run.
 The long term is driven by the supply constrain.
 All adjustment processes are achieved: there is no error of anticipation
 and the effective quantities coincide with the optimal ones.
 The prices are fully adjusted and all markets are in equilibrium.
 The unemployment reaches its structural level.
 The economy thus converges toward a stable equilibrium growth path à la
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 where all real variables grow at the same rate defined as the sum of the
 growth rate of the technical progress and of the population.
 Per capita real variables grow thus at the same rate as the technical progress.
 All prices grow at the rate of inflation which is defined by the exogenous
 rate of inflation in the rest of the world.
 The endogenous dynamic of the model is determined by capital accumulation
 of households and firms, the specification of the anticipation and of the
 adjustment dynamic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Three-ME aims also to overcome the restriction imposed by nested Constant
 Elasticity of Substitution (CES) functions by assuming a more flexible
 form of the production function.
 This is a clear difference with most CGEM where the technology is generally
 represented by a series of nested CES production function (e.g.

).
 Nested CES functions proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Sato:1967kl"

\end_inset

 have the advantage to allow for different elasticities of substitutions
 between production factors that are not in the same nested structure.
 But within the same CES, the elasticity of substitution is common to all
 factors.
 For instance, if several energy inputs are represented within the same
 CES, the elasticity of substitution is the same between all these energy
 inputs.
 This may be a very strong assumption in some cases.
 Three-ME does not impose this restriction by assuming a flexible function
 where the elasticity of substitution is not necessary common between all
 the inputs of the same nested structure.
 This allows changing easily the hypotheses about the value of elasticity
 of substitutions without having to change the structure of the nest.

Three-ME model is programmed on the E-views 7 package software and simulated

\color black
Two version of the model can be simulated.
 The "analytic" version uses the standard Linear Expenditure System (LES)
 utility function to model the consumption of every commodities (including,
 cars, transport and housing investments).
 This gives a benchmark particularly useful to test the consistency of the
 model and its basic properties.
 In particular, this version allows for testing the consistency of the data,
 of the calibration of parameters and variables and of the model specification
 with the standard assumption of stable equilibrium growth path à la Solow
 (1956).
 Indeed, with a LES hypothesis, and in the absence of error of parametrization
 and specification, the model can simulate a stable equilibrium growth path
 from the first period onward (see Appendix A).
 Implementing standard shock allows to see if the dynamic is consistent
 with a stable path.
 In the hybrid version, the modeling of the household include bottom-up
 elements for the consumption of car, transport, housing and energy.
 The other commodities are still model using the LES hypothesis.

The demand and supply equilibrium simply models the national account equilibrium.
 The base year 2006 has been calibrated on the input-output tables and resources
 and uses tables of the French national accounts (available on www.insee.fr).
 In order to derive price indexes, each variables (GDP, consumption, investment,

 For calibration convenience, each prices are calibrated to unity.

Compared to standard walrasian CG model, the equality between supply and

 In coherence with a neo-keynesian framework, prices and quantities are

 Although we assume, for simplicity, that producer are always able to match
 the demand, supply shortages are taken into account by assuming that they
 increase the production price.

For quantity and prices, the adjustment process and expectations are specified
 according to the following equations: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ln(X_{t})=\lambda_{0}^{X}.ln(X_{t}^{n})+(1-\lambda_{0}^{X})(ln(X_{t-1})+\Delta ln(X_{t}^{e}))\label{eq:Adjust Notional}

\Delta ln(X_{t}^{e})=\lambda_{1}^{X}.\Delta ln(X_{t-1}^{e})+\lambda_{2}^{X}.\Delta ln(X_{t-1})+\lambda_{3}^{X}.\Delta ln(X_{t}^{n})+\lambda_{4}^{X}.\Delta ln(X_{t+1})\label{eq:Adjust Expect}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the effective value of a given variable (e.g.
 the production price, labor, capital, etc), 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}^{n}$
\end_inset

 its notional (or desired) level, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}^{e}$
\end_inset

 its expected (anticipated) value at period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The first equation assumes a geometric adjustment process.
 The taking into account of the anticipation warrants that in the long run
 the effective variable converge to their desired levels.
 The second equation assumes a general specification for expectation that
 combines backward-looking and forward-looking expectation.
 We assume further that in the long run expectations are accurate: 
\begin_inset Formula ${\scriptscriptstyle {\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{4}\lambda_{i}^{X}=1}}$
\end_inset

.
 The above specification is simple and relatively general since it can be
 calibrated to match other usual specification such as Error Correction

 We also assume that substitution effect adjust slowly:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above 3 equations allows for a rich set of adjustment processes since
 they introduce different types of rigidity, i.e.
 on price and quantity, on expectations, and on substitution mechanisms.
 To illustrate, let us describe more specifically the case of labor by introduci
ng the notional labor demand and notional substitution effects:
\end_layout

 & \qquad-\eta_{j}^{LM}\varphi_{a,t-1}^{Mat}\Delta(c_{a,t}^{L}-p_{a,t}^{Mat})\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These notional value are those the producer would like to reach immediately
 if there were no adjustment constraint.
 Because of adjustment costs, we assume that this process takes time.
 We introduce inertia in substitution mechanisms to account for the fact
 that the impact of substitution is generally slower than the impact of
 production on the demand for inputs.

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in Figure

, the production structure is decomposed in 3 levels.
 The first level assumes a technology with four production factors (or inputs)
 sometimes referred as a KLEM (Capital, Labor, Energy, Material) technology,
 thus splitting intermediary consumptions into energy and material.
 Compared to most existing models, we do not necessarily assume a Constant
 Elasticity of Substitution (CES) between these factors.
 For instance the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor may
 differ from the one between capital and energy.
 To do so we use a generalized CES (GCES) function
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We added a fifth element in level one: the transport and commercial margins.
 Stricto sensus, they cannot be considered as production factors since they
 intervene after the production process.
 Thus they are not substitutable with the production factor.
 But they are closely related to the level of production since once a good
 has been processed, it has to be transported and commercialized.
 At the second level, the investment, energy, material and margins aggregates
 are further decomposed.
 The investment level is determined by the capital stock assuming a constant
 depreciation ratio.
 At the third level, the demand for each factor or margin is either imported
 or produced domestically.
 The generalized CES function is also used to capture substitutions effect
 at the level 2 and 3.
 Moreover, we assume at each level a degree 1 homogenous function that a
 constant return-to-scale technology.

An hybrid modeling of households'behaviour
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard representation of the consumer maximization behavior used in
 most top-down CGEM assumes that energy sources provide utility on their
 one.
 Therefore their consumption is more or less proportional to their revenue
 because of the hypothesis of nested utility function.
 But in reality energy has no use in itself.
 Households buy energy to fulfill certain services such as housing (heating
 and the functioning of equipments) or transport.
 Therefore the quantity of energy consumed for heating purposes is more
 related to the size of the house than directly to the revenue of households.
 Of course, rich households generally have bigger houses and therefore their
 energy consumption will generally be higher.
 At the same time, one can expect that the energy consumption per square
 meters will be lower for poor households since they are generally more
 careful in trying to limit their energy bill.
 Indeed, micro data suggest that the poor households tend to lower heating
 temperature in their houses.
 The energy consumption per m² tends to increase with the income decile

 but within limit since energy is more a necessity good than a luxury good.
 And hardly no one wants a heating temperature in their house of 35 °C even
 very rich people.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to model this is to assume that the production of certain services
 such housing and mobility is directly produced by households rather than
 purchase externally.
 Therefore we specify explicitly a household’s production function for the
 services of housing and mobility (Figure

).
 The block has two main components: housing, transport.
 We assume further that the expenses related to this production function
 is priority.
 For the other expenditures, we use a standard LES which allows to model
 in a simple way the distinction between necessity/luxury goods.

To provide a better intuition, the stock dynamic is charted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Blue arrows represent the depreciation mechanism.
 As time goes along, high energy classes loses efficiency and gets downgraded
 until they gets eventually destructed (pool 
\begin_inset Formula $BUIL_{h,0,t}$
\end_inset

).
 As in the model, this chart presents the general case where the downgrading
 is possible to any lower class.
 In reality, this process is generally gradual and buildings of high classes
 will go successively to lower classes instead of been directly destructed.
 Orange arrows represent the rehabilitation mechanism: by investing in renovatio
n, households have the possibility to increase the energy efficiency of
 their house.
 Here too various transitions are possible, e.g.
 from class 1 to 2, then from 2 to 3 or directly from class 1 to 4.
 Naturally, the strongest the rehabilitation, the higher the cost.
 Finally, black arrows represent the (re)-construction process.
 There are new buildings because the total housing park increases (
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle BUIL$
\end_inset

) and because destroyed buildings (
\begin_inset Formula $BUIL_{h,0,t}$
\end_inset

) are reconstructed.
 Here as well, although new buildings are possible in any category, in practice,
 new construction follows high energy efficiency standards.

At each period, a proportion of the buildings of category k is rehabilitated:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{h,k}^{REHAB}=\underset{k'}{\sum}REHAB_{h,k,k'}/BUIL_{h,k}$
\end_inset

.
 This proportion may not be constant over time.
 For instance, it may increase as the energy price increases because this
 gives an incentive toward more energy efficiency renovation.
 This can be modeled by assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{h,k}^{REHAB}$
\end_inset

 is endogenous and depends on the user cost of the building.
 Variation in that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{h,k}^{REHAB}$
\end_inset

 may also be exogenous due to the imposition of stricter energy efficiency
 requirements embodied in 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{h,k}^{REHAB*}$
\end_inset

.
 Naturally, the proportion of the buildings that are renovated cannot exceed
 1.
 But it appears logical to assume that it has also a lower bound (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{h,k}^{REHAB\_l}$
\end_inset

 ) to account for irreversibility phenomena: even if the energy price starts
 to go down, it is possible that households will not lower their investment
 in energy efficiency.
 These considerations lead to the following specification:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau_{h,k}^{REHAB} & = & \tau_{h,k}^{REHAB*}+\eta_{h,k}\frac{UC_{h,k}^{REHAB}}{UC_{h,k}}\nonumber \\

\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $UC_{h,k}$
\end_inset

 is the user cost of buildings of type k and 
\begin_inset Formula $UC_{h,k}^{REHAB}$
\end_inset

 is the user cost of the investment in the renovation of building k.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained previously, the rehabilitation of a building of a given class
 k can be done to different higher classes.
 It would be logical to assume that the choice between the higher classes
 is endogenous and depends on the relative cost of each option of renovation.
 However, because of the lack of data, it is difficult to model and calibrate
 such arbitrage.
 Moreover, this choice may be strongly determined by technical renovation
 standards with a small influence of relative prices.
 Therefore, we assume that this choice is exogenous, that is the share of
 class k buildings rehabilitated to class k' (
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{k,k'}^{REHAB}$
\end_inset

 ) is exogenous: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
REHAB_{h,k,k'} & = & \varphi_{h,k,k'}^{REHAB}.\tau_{h,k}^{REHAB}BUIL_{h,k,t-1}\\

\begin_layout Standard
In Equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:8"

\end_inset

), we assume that the proportion of the buildings of category k to be rehabilita
ted depends on the user cost of buildings.
 We assume that the latter corresponds to the annual cost of the investment
 which consists of two components: (1) the annual cost of the investment
 itself including eventual interests, (2) annual energy cost.
 This leads to the following relation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The energy consumption per km, the number of km per year varies between
 households since it is generally higher for the highest decile.
 So it is logical to assume that these variables are related to the level
 of revenue.
 At the same time, given that housing is a necessity “commodity” for household,
 it is logical to assume a lower and a higher bound.
 To impose high and low boundaries, we assume the following logistic function
 specification:

Assuming that of

, several studies have observed that the labor force participation depends
 on the labor market situation in particular because of a discouraged-worker

 Thus, the labor participation ratio may be endogenous and depend negatively
 on the unemployment rate:

 who estimate this parameter for 12 sex and age cohorts (See Figure

).
 This studies find that the OECD labor participation of certain categories
 is particularly sensitive to the labor market situation.
 Typically for the youngest and the eldest, a discouraged-worker effect
 generally appears: their participation decreases when the situation on
 the labor market deteriorates.
 For France and other Continental European countries, an additional worker
 effect dominates for women between 25 and 55 years old.
 Accounting for an endogenous labor participation ratio seems empirically
 consistent and therefore allows for a more precise measure of the unemployment
 variation for each population and at the aggregate level.

External Trade

\begin_layout Standard
The external trade in Three-ME is treated with a relatively high level of

 On the one hand, import behaviors are specific for each economic actor

 On the other hand, the model integrates explicit external demand functions
 of both the domestic production and the importations with a constant price
 elasticity.

\begin_layout Standard
Following the

’s (1969) approach, the international trade is justified by the differentiation
 of products between regions of the world.
 This explanation assumes implicitly the imperfect substitutability between
 domestic and imported products.
 To determine the volume of imports by product, each economic actor minimizes
 the purchasing costs under the constraint of a predetermined absorption
 level and a CES substitution pattern.
 This can be formulated as:

An alternative approach which is using frequently in CGEM, but less realistic,
 consists in assuming an infinite price elasticity between exports and the

 the domestic price does not differ from the international price.
 In this case, the volume of exports is limited by supply

\begin_layout Standard
The prices in THREE-ME follow a bottom-up structure.
 The production price is defined at the lowest level as a mark-up over the
 production cost (labor, capital, energy and other intermediary raw consumptions
).
 The domestic price for commodities includes, in addition to the production
 price, commercial and transport margins, and taxes on products net from
 subsidies.
 Combined with the import price, we get a price for each commodity.
 Depending on the destination of the product, the price may vary since certain
 taxes or subsidies do not apply uniformaly to every clients.
 For instance, VAT affects primary consumers but not exports and subsidies
 affect only the domestic price.
 As a feedback, final demand prices affect the production price through
 several canals.
 The agregate consumer price defines inflation which is (at least partially)
 repercuted into wage and thus costs.
 Inflation also increases the real interest rate and therefore the cost
 of capital because of the monetary policy of the central bank.
 Final demand prices affect also production costs via the price of intermediaty
 consumption and of investment.
 These interactions and feedbacks between prices, wages, and production
 costs are schematized in Figure

In order to describe as clearly as possible the construction of prices in
 Three-ME, we begin with the production prices fixed by firms.
 With the import prices, the system of production prices is the key element
 in the price structure since all other prices are derived from them by
 adding taxes or/and deducting subsidies according to the destination of
 each product.
 In the case of imperfect competition, firms choose the price that maximizes
 their profit as a mark-up 
\begin_inset Formula $TMD_{a,t}$

 over the unit cost of production: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Notice that

 It should not be seen as a composite of several "goods": production at

 Indeed, its does not increase when the volume of the commercial and transport
 margins increase.
 The price does instead.
 Its specification is 
\begin_inset Formula $YQS{}_{c,t}=YQ{}_{c,t}\left(1+T_{c,0}^{ENERT}+T_{c,0}^{OTHD}+T_{c,0}^{SUB}+\frac{MTD_{c,0}}{YQ{}_{c,0}}+\frac{MCD_{c,0}}{YQ{}_{c,0}}\right)$

 We provide below the specification for the final price of commodities produced

In theory, VAT applies only on households'final consumption and should therefore
 be paid only by consumers.
 In practice, desagregated data by commodity show that sectors pay also
 a small amount of VAT since (a) VAT is paid on product not consumed by
 households and (b) the apparent rate on several products would exceed the
 legal rate if the VAT was exclusively paid by households.
 Therefore, we distinguish 2 VAT rate: one paid on consumption and another
 one paid on intermediary consumption, sectoral investment and public spending:

Greenhouse gases emissions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In France, the anthropogenic CO2 emissions represent about 70% of the total
 gross greenhouse gases (GHG).
 They come from the burning of fossil fuels and decarbonation process.
 The modeling of the demand for fossil energy in Three-ME is detailed by
 economic agent, by kind of fossil energy and by emission process.
 This allows for a precise estimation of the variation in the national CO2
 emissions.
 The calculation of emissions level consists in multiplying the fossil energy
 demand by the corresponding emission coefficients.
 These coefficients are specific for each economic actor, each sector and
 each energy sources depending on their carbon intensity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CO2 emissions due to the combustion of fossil energy by sectors and
 households are proportional to the quantity of fossil fuel energy consumed.
 They are therefore calculated according to the following equations:

Long term of the model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The long term steady state of the model is generally defined as a state
 where all variables grow at a constant rate.
 This state is coherent with the representation of a stable economy able
 to maintain a given configuration forever.
 This implies that rates such as the unemployment or labor participation
 ratios, tax rates are constant in the long run.
 This is coherent with the fact that these ratios lie by definition between
 0 and 100% and thus cannot be affected by a trend forever.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most shares should also be constant.
 For instance, the shares of investment or of consumption into GDP should
 be constant.
 Otherwise the effect of one of these two determinants of the GDP vanishes
 over time.
 The same argument holds for the share of one sector in the total in terms
 of labor or production: we expect an economy where all sectors remains
 in the long run, which implies that some economic mechanisms guaranty stable
 share for each sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some exceptions are possible.
 As empirically observed, it seems realistic that the share of labor into
 the GDP decreases over time because of the technical progress.
 But the share of the efficient labor, that is including the technical progress,
 remains constant.
 Because of the globalization of the economy, the ratio between export and
 production may also increase permanently in the long run.
 But in the long run this effect is expected to be compensated by the increase
 in the ratio between import and production so that the share of the external
 balance into production remains constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the long run, all relative prices are expected to be constant.
 This implies that all prices grow at the same rate.
 This guaranty that the economy is not affected by substitution mechanisms
 in the long run: firms do not want to change the share of each production
 factors into production and consumers are satisfied with share of each
 good into their aggregate consumption.
 It implies also that each agent is satisfied with their share of the global
 revenue: firms do not want to change the growth rate of their price whereas
 employees do not want to change the growth rate of their wage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,\tau,\mu,\pi$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 are the growth rates of the population, of the technical progress, of the
 real economy (i.e.
 of the GDP), of prices (i.e.
 inflation), and of wages, the long run value of these rate cannot be chosen
 independently.
 First, the growth rate of the real economy should be equal to the sum of
 the growth rate of the population and of the technical progress:
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=\nu+\tau$
\end_inset

.
 This condition is a direct consequence of the hypothesis of constant return
 to scales (homogeneous of degree 1) of the production function.
 In the long run, relative price are constant and the labor demand [12]
 implies that production grows at the sum of the growth rates of labor and
 technical progress
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta y_{jt}=\Delta l_{jt}+\Delta p_{jt}^{rog}$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, the stability of unemployment rate implies that labor grows
 at the same rate as the population (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:57old"

\end_inset

).
 In the long run, the price equation implies that the growth rate of wages
 should be equal to the sum of inflation and of the growth rate of the technical
 progress.
 This holds only if some economic mechanisms imply that the unemployment
 rate converge to the NAIRU.
 The latter depends on the parameter of the Phillips curve

\begin_layout Standard
In the model several stabilizing equation guaranty that the economy return
 to stationary path after a shock.
 Inflationary shocks degrade the external position of France by decreasing
 export and increasing imports.
 In addition, the Taylor rule combined with the negative impact of the real
 interest rate on the demand prevents inflationary shock to lead to an explosive
 inflation dynamic.
 The negative impact of the real interest rate on the activity has several
 possible canals:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Consumption: in coherence with a life-cycle model and the possibility of
 an intertemporal allocation of their resource, households may increase
 their savings when the real interest rate increases and thus reduces their
 consumptions.
 They may also have Ricardian behavior in the long run by internalizing
 the government and firms' budget constraints.
 They may thus adjust their consumption in such way that the ratio between
 their savings and the national debt is constant in order to insure the
 sustainability of the debt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Investment: firms may choose their investment level that is coherent with
 the stability of their debt into the value-added.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tax and public spending: the government is expected to choose the tax rate
 and public spending levels that are coherent with a stable debt into the
 GDP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consistency of a dynamic model with a stationary equilibrium requires
 long term constraints which depend on the type of mathematical equation.
 We briefly detailed the main cases that are encountered in Three-ME and
 how the model can be calibrated in order to be at the stationary state
 from the first period of the simulation onward.
 It should be noted that this assumption is made to verify the coherence
 of the data calibration and of the dynamic properties of the model.
 Some of the constraints needed to guaranty a permanent stationary state
 are quite restrictive.
 For instance, it implies a strict relation between stock and flow values
 (e.g.
 capital and investment, see below) which may not be satisfied at the base
 year.
 Also, the growth rates of population, and of technical progress should
 always be constant, which is not verify empirically.
 For this reason, we simulate also realistic baseline scenarios where the
 model is fully calibrated on empirical data and on realistic projections
 for the exogenous variables.

Additive equations

\begin_layout Standard
In the model, many relations enter in an additive form: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{t}=\sum_{i=1}^{I}X_{it}\label{eq:81old}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are in general definitions such as the GDP decomposition or income,
 etc.
 In case of an additive equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:81old"

\end_inset

, the variable Y grows at the rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 from the first period onward if all its components X grow also at that
 rate: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{t}=\Bigg(\sum_{i=1}^{I}X_{i,0}\Bigg)(1+\mu)^{t}=Y_{\text{0}}(1+\mu)^{t}\label{eq:82old}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover in that case all ratios between variables 
\begin_inset Formula $(\frac{X_{i}}{Y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{Xi}{Xj}$
\end_inset

) are constant over time.
 In the case of the GDP equation this seems a realistic long run property.
 Otherwise the share of each component in the GDP is not stable over time
 and the long run growth rate of the GDP corresponds to the component’s
 highest growth rate.
 Indeed, if the X-variables do not grow at the same rate, the growth rate
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y(\mu)$
\end_inset

 converges to the highest X-variable growth rate.
 And the share of the X-variable with a lower growth rate tends toward zero.
 This mathematical property may imply unrealistic constraint on the model
 if one wants to be at the steady states at the first period of the simulation.
 This is particularly true if one wishes to calibrate the model on real
 data.
 We can give 2 examples: For instance, it is unrealistic to assume that
 a negative inventory change will decrease indefinitely because the level
 of inventories becomes at some point negative.
 One possibility is to amend the calibration in order to impose a zero-inventory
 change at the base years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the real world, most countries’ imports and exports do not grow at the
 rate of the GDP but at a higher rate because of the trade globalization.
 In fact Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:81old"

\end_inset

 allows that several X-variables grow at a different rate than Y in the
 long run as long their sum grows at the same rate as Y.
 Consequently, imports and exports may grow faster that the GDP forever
 as long as their effect cancel out, that is as long as the foreign trade
 balance grows at the rate of the GDP.
 If the long run foreign trade balance is zero, imports and exports grow
 at the same rate.
 If not, they grow at the same rate asymptotically, the smallest (in absolute
 value) growing faster.
 This implies mechanism that imposes import and export to grow consistently.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the production factors demand, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 depends on the relative prices and thus may vary over time in case of shock
 or if they are not in equilibrium in the initial period.

 guaranty the long run stability of relative prices.

 of the production function:
\end_layout

We have just shown that at the neighbourhood of the optimum any linearly
 homogeneous, twice differentiable, strictly increasing and concave production
 function can be approximated by a Cobb-Douglas with technical coefficients
 that varies over time.
 Moreover these technical coefficients correspond to the input share into
 production.
 They are stable in the long run because the specification of Three-ME guarantie
s the stability of ratios between prices and of input to production ratios.
 Suppose further that the direct elasticity of substitution – in the sense
 of Hicks (1932) and Robinson (1933) – between inputs 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula $h'$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{hh'}$
\end_inset

 is not necessarily the same between each couple of production factors.
 This elasticity measures the change in the ratio between two factors of
 production due to a change in their relative marginal productivity, i.e.
 in the marginal rate of substitution (in the slope of the iso-production
 curve): 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The introduction of technical progress and non constant return-to-scale
 is straightforward and does not alter the results.
 In the first case one can simply define 
\begin_inset Formula $X{}_{ht}=I_{ht}^{nput}P_{ht}^{rog}$
\end_inset

 as the efficient input, which includes the technical progress 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{ht}^{rog}$
\end_inset

 ,
\begin_inset Formula $I_{ht}^{nput}$
\end_inset

 being the effective input.
 In the second case, one can simply define production as an homogenous function
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta:Y_{t}=Q_{t}^{\theta}$
\end_inset

 decreasing) return-to-scale, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta>1$
\end_inset

 (resp.

 Integrating technical progress and non constant return-to-scale leads to
 the following input demand: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
I_{ht}^{nput}=\theta^{-1}y_{t}-p_{ht}^{rog}-\sum_{h=1,h\neq h'}^{H}\eta_{hh'}\varphi_{h't}(p_{ht}^{X}-p_{h't}^{X})\label{eq:Input demand}

GCES consumer utility function and demand for goods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Three-ME, the demand for goods is treated in a similar way as the demand
 for input.
 Let us assume that at a first stage the consumer divides (eventually via
 an intertemporal maximization program) her revenue between expenditures
 and savings.
 For a given level desired volume of expenditure 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 , the consumer is then assumed to minimize the cost of this expenditure.
 The substitutability between the different consumption goods (or expenditures),
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{h}$
\end_inset

 , is measured through a 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 goods-utility function having the same property as the production function
 defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: production function"

\end_inset

.
 Formally the optimization program is the same as the one of the producer.
 It consists in minimizing the cost of expenditure
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Cost function"

\end_inset

 subject to the utility function constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: production function"

\end_inset

.
 The demand for goods is thus 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:demand of factors"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that minimizing the cost of expenditure subject to a utility function
 constraint give the same result as the standard approach which consists
 in maximizing the utility 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: production function"

\end_inset

 subject to a budget constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:budget constraint"

\end_inset

: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{h=1}^{H}P_{ht}^{X}X_{ht}=P_{t}^{Q}Q_{t}\label{eq:budget constraint}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lagrangian to this problem is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L_{t}=Q_{t}-\lambda\bigg(\sum_{h=1}^{H}P_{ht}^{X}X_{ht}-P_{t}^{Q}Q_{t}\bigg)\label{Lagrangian}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The necessary first order conditions (
\begin_inset Formula $L'(X_{ht})=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L'(\lambda)=0)$
\end_inset

 are the well-know conditions that the ratio between marginal utilities
 of two goods equals the one between their prices (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:FOC"

\end_inset

 and thus
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:input share"

\end_inset

) and the budget constraint (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:budget constraint"

\end_inset

).
 Using a first-order Taylor expansion on Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:budget constraint"

\end_inset

 (divided by
\begin_inset Formula $P^{Q}$
\end_inset

) in the neighbourhood of the stationary equilibrium characterized by the
 stability of price ratios ( 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{h}^{X}/P_{h'}^{X}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $P_{h}^{X}/P^{Q}$
\end_inset

 ), allows for rewriting the budget constraint as
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Prod function bis"

\end_inset

.
 As we have now the same system to solve as in the producer case (Equations
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:input share"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Prod function bis"

\end_inset

), the demand for good is thus 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:demand of factors"

\end_inset

.
 Notice that the particular case of a CES function 
\begin_inset Formula $(\eta_{hh'}/P_{h'}^{X})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:demand of factors"

\end_inset

 simplifies.
 To see this, let us first use a first-order Taylor expansion on Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:budget constraint"

\end_inset

 (divided by 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{t}$
\end_inset

) in the neighbourhood of the stationary equilibrium characterized by the
 stability of ratios between volumes 
\begin_inset Formula $(X_{h}/X_{h'}X_{h}/Q)$
\end_inset

,.
 This conveniently allows expressing the consumer price as a weighted average
 of the prices of goods, the weight being the share into consumption (Equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:value share"

\end_inset

): 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat}{1}
\dot{P_{t}^{Q}} & =\sum_{h=1}^{H}\varphi_{ht}\dot{P}_{ht}^{X}\Leftrightarrow p_{t}^{Q}=\sum_{h=1}^{H}\varphi_{ht}p_{ht}^{X}\label{eq:Consumer price function}
\end{alignat}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming a constant elasticity of substitution 
\begin_inset Formula $(\eta_{hh'}=\eta)$

 between goods and combining the price equation

LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Consumer price function"

\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:demand of factors"

\end_inset

, the demand for goods simplifies and depends only on the relative price
 between the price of goods and the consumer price:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x_{t}=q_{t}-\eta(p_{ht}^{X}-p_{t}^{Q})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not surprisingly this relation is the same as the one deduced from a direct
 maximization of CES utility function subject to a budget constraint (see
 Blanchard and Fischer, 1989; Blanchard and Kiyotaki, 1987; Dixit and Stiglitz,
 1977).
 The only difference is that the consumer price index
\begin_inset Formula $(P_{t}^{Q})$
\end_inset

 is a linear approximation of the Dixit-Stiglitz index which is a CES function
 of the price of goods.
 As demonstrated by Arrow et al.
 (1961), Leontief and Cobb-Douglas functions are particular cases of a CES
 function where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 tends to 0 and 1 respectively.
