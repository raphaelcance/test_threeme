\begin_layout Abstract
Since 2008, the ADEME and the OFCE are involved in a research convention
 to develop the model Three-ME.
 This document provides a full description of new version of the model.
 Three-ME is a new model of the French economy especially designed to evaluate
 the medium and long term impact of environmental and energy policies at
 the macroeconomic and sector levels.
 To do so Three-ME combines two important features.
 Firstly, it has the main characteristics of neo-Keynesian models by assuming
 a slow adjustment of effective quantities and prices to their notional
 level.
 Compared to standard multi-sector CGEM, this has the advantage to allow
 for the existence of under-optimum equilibria such as the presence of involunta
ry unemployment.
 Secondly, Three-ME is a hybrid model in the sense that it combines the
 top-down approach of general equilibrium macroeconomic models with elements
 of bottom-up models of energy models developed by engineers.
 As in bottom-up models, the amount of energy consumed is related to their
 use, that is the number of buildings or cars, and the energy class to which
 they belong.
 This hypothesis is more realistic compared to the assumption made in the
 the majority of top-down models where energy consumption is usually directly
 related to income through a nested structure of utility function.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Section 11 looks at the dynamic properties of the model by simulating the
 macroeconomic and sectoral impact of various shocks such a positive demand
 shock via the increase in public spending, a positive supply shock via
 the decrease in the employer social security rate, and the increase in
 the oil price and in the labor participation rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Analytical scenarios
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we conduct several analytical scenarios in order to test
 the properties of the model.
 In particular we look how the main macroeconomic and sectoral indicators
 react after standard shocks such as an expansionary policy, a tax decrease
 or an increase in the oil price.
 Analytical scenarios are sometimes referred by modeler as “naive” scenarios
 in the sense that they do not integrate the most realistic feature of the
 model.
 Typically here, we assume a reference scenario where all variables grow
 at a constant rate at every period which implies some constraint that may
 not be realistic.
 For instance, the share of oil into the final consumption is assumed stable
 over time which is in contradiction with empirical fact: in reality, the
 share of energy consumption tends to decrease with economic development
 since energy is generally a necessity good.
 With this hypothesis, the model tends to exaggerate the increase in GHG
 emissions of any policy that increases the revenue of households.
 Avoiding this problem is particularly important when one wants to evaluate
 for instance the impact of a carbon tax.
 This requires the use of a “realistic scenario” that assumes that the elasticit
y between oil consumption and revenue is lower than one.
 Another necessary constraint to have a stationary reference scenario from
 the base year onwards is the assumption that the unemployment rate is at
 its equilibrium level at the base year (above 8% in 2006).
 The interpretation of any analytical scenario should keep in mind such
 hypothesis.
 If there are good reasons to believe that the equilibrium rate of unemployment
 is below 8%, this simulation tends to exaggerate the inflationary pressure
 of any policy that reduces the unemployment rate.
 Despite this caveat, analytical scenarios provide useful information on
 the long term and dynamic properties of the model.
 In particular, they allow for testing the dynamic stability of the model
 after a given shock and to control if the specification of the model insures
 the convergence to the long term equilibrium.
 In general, after a shock all the variables converge towards their long
 term value following a damped cyclical dynamic.
 The second cycle is generally very close to the long term values.
 This cyclical dynamic comes mainly from the interaction between the Keynesian
 multipliers (in particular of investment due to the specification of the
 equation of capital accumulation) and the inflation dynamic.
 In a first phase, the investment multiplier accentuates the effect of any
 favorable shock.
 This tends to decrease the unemployment rate below its equilibrium level.
 The subsequent increase in inflation reduces the internal and external
 demand bringing back the economy below its long term trend.
 This brings the unemployment rate above its equilibrium value.
 When inflation is low enough, the favorable phase of the cycle starts again.
 The length of the cycle is determined by the delay in the adjustment process
 of the effective prices and quantities toward their notional values.
 Because all the adjustment process follows a geometric adjustment process,
 effective values reach their notional values only asymptotically.
 To measure how fast, this adjustment process is, is it useful to define
 the adjustment delay as the length time it takes to reach a 90% adjustment.
 Under this definition, the calibrated adjustment delays are 3 years for
 the production prices and wages, 4 years for the production factors, 2
 years for consumption, and 2 years for energy

Expansionary policy: one GDP point-increase of public spending
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first simulate the medium and long term impact of an expantionary policy:
 a one GDP point-increase of public spending.
 Since, governement spending at the base year accounts for about one quarter
 of the GDP, this shock correponds to an increase of 4% of public expenditure.
 The proportion of this impulse in terms of products is proportional to
 the base year public consumption:

\begin_layout Subsection
Expansionary policy: decrease in the employer social security rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decline in employers' social contributions is one another example of
 an expansionist policy through the reduction of the labor cost.
 We simulate a decrease in the employer social contribution of 1 point of
 GDP which matches a decrease of 7.35% uniform rate apparent for all industries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lower cost of labor induced by this shock will play on two levels.First
 on the price level by decreasing the cost of production which leads to
 an increase in the household's real disposable income and thus consumption.
 In the very short run the disinflationary impact and the substitution mechanism
s keep constant investment.
 To this effect combines a lower level of unemployment of 0.1 points in 2010
 year and 1.1 points in 2015 years.
 This is due to the effect of stimulus on demand and from improvement of
 the competitiveness relatively to the rest of the world but also to changes
 in relative prices between inputs resulting in a substitution toward labor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Effects on activity are therefore positive.
 The lower cost of labor and thus production improves competitiveness.
 This results in an improvement in the terms of trade.
 Indeed, the fall in prices led to an increase in exports greater than the
 increase in imports resulting from the increased activity.
 the early imports fall because of improved competitiveness.
 In the medium term, the income effect prevails and imports increase.
 While improving the competitiveness leads to an improvement in the trade
 balance volume , the trade balance in value decreases due to the decrease
 in producer prices: France sells more but cheaper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the long run, the decline in the unemployment rate generates an inflationary
 effect and therefore a degradation term competitiveness.
 So that long-term positive effect on employment measures fades.

\begin_layout Subsection
A 50% increase of the oil price
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 50% increase in the oil price is a pure supply shock and has a negative
 impact on the GDP through a reduction of all the component of the demand.
 The reduction of the real disposable income affects the consumption and
 thus the GDP.
 The change in the relative price induces for the producers to switch from
 a more energy-intensive technology toward a more capital-intensive technology.
 We observe that this slight increase in the first years of the investment
 which is due to a substitution effect from the energy input toward the
 capital is offset by the negative effect on the activity and thus is negative
 four periods after the shock.
 Besides this effect on the demand, the oil shock degrades french exports
 by increasing the export prices.
 We can point out that we have a

\end_inset

 view on this shock, since in our framework the world prices are exogenous
 and so unimpacted by the oil price shock.
 This leads to an overestimation of the impact on the commercial balance,
 considering that only the France will face a rising in the oil price.

\begin_layout Standard
Not surprisingly, all the sectors are negatively impacted.
 In the energy sectors, the oil is naturally the most impacted activity
 but the over ones, especially the gas production sectors, benefit from
 a inter-energy substitution effect and observe an increase in their demand.

A increase of one point of the labor participation ratio
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An exogenous increase in the labor participation ratio consecutive for instance
 of an increase in the legal retirement age has a positive impact on the
 activity since it increases the potential output of the economy.
 However, as the adjustment process is slow, the unemployment rate increases.
 The subsequent decrease in inflation is favorable for the economic activity
 and thus decreases unemployment: the improvement of the external position
 leads to an increase of the exports, and the decrease of the interest rate
 is favorable to investment.
